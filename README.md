Using Tableau, a data visualization tool, an analysis report has been generated to understand and improve the global superstoreâ€™s standing in the market. Through the business insights collated via this report, it allows the global superstore to make crucial decisions and paints a clear picture on where to divert its resources and focus onto. The report dwells on 5 specific areas. Amongst these areas, statistically significant issues are filtered and analysed in depth to narrow down countries, markets, regions, sub-categories and products that are generating profits as well as losses. Additionally, recommendations will be made, to advice the senior management as to how problems areas can be acted upon to bring about increased sales and profits. 
Through this project, I was able to sieve through large amounts of data to provide insights and recommendations while	discovering interesting trends, patterns and relationships between various measures and dimensions.
